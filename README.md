# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
Overview
Welcome to the "IMDB Movie Analysis" project repository! In this project, we dive into the world of movie analytics using IMDB data. Our goal is to investigate the factors influencing the success of a movie on IMDB, defined by high IMDB ratings. This analysis is crucial for movie producers, directors, and investors to make informed decisions in their future projects.

Project Details
Difficulty Level: Intermediate

Description: We'll start by cleaning the dataset to make it suitable for analysis, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing feature engineering if necessary. Then, we'll delve into data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, such as movie genres, duration, language, directors, and budgets, with IMDB ratings.

Utilizing the Five 'Whys' Approach, we'll dig deeper into the underlying factors influencing movie success. Subsequently, we'll create a report and data story, presenting our findings and insights using visualizations to drive decision-making.
